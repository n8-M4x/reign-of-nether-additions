-------------

Tthings to regression test once PRs are merged

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
[✔] Alliance System (Thanks to @Boobcat)
    - /ally <player name> to send an alliance request to another player
    - /allyconfirm <requester name> to accept an alliance request
    - /disband <player name> to end an alliance
    - Allies are shown as blue in unit/building highlights and the minimap
    - Allies win and lose together
    - Allying a player will not automatically ally you with their allies
    - Effects that don't friendly fire like creepers should also not affect allies
    - You can still force attack allies using A + left-click

[✔] Translation Compatibility (Thanks to @Promethia)
    - Added language support for:
        - Danish (da_dk)
        - Polish (pl_pl)
        - Russian (ru_ru)
        - Ukrainian (uk_ua)
        - Brazilian Portuguese (pt_br)
        - Chinese (Simplified) (zh_cn)
        - Chinese (Traditional) (zh_tw)

    - Some languages may not yet have support for Alliances since it was just added
    - If a string in your language is not available, it will default to English
    - Due to an unforseen bug, you must restart your client when switching languages for it to take effect
    - If you would like to contribute translations, please see the #localisation channel and the pinned post
